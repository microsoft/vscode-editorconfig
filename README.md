# Editor Config for Visual Studio Code

> **This version of the Editor Config extension has been deprecated.**

> Please see [editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode) for the latest Editor Config extension for VS Code.

The `microsoft/vscode-editorconfig` extension was initially created to validate the VS Code extension API. This has been a very popular extension that is now actively being enhanced and maintained by the community at [editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode).

We are excited to see the community take ownership of this extension. As a result, we are no longer maintaining this version. We recommend that you uninstall the Microsoft version (published by `Chris Dias`) by bringing up the Command Palette, typing in `ext Editor Config`, and clicking on the Uninstall icon:

Afte restarting VS Code, you can install the latest from the `EditorConfig` publisher:

We apologize for the inconvenience and thank the community for taking this on!
